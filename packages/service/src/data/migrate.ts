 * Migration files in the order they must be applied.
 *
 * Order is everything: a migration that adds a column runs against the table an
 * earlier one created, so applying them out of order either fails loudly or, worse,
 * succeeds into a schema that differs from everyone else's.
 *
 * Two things could silently get this wrong, so both are ruled out here rather than
 * left to convention:
 *
 * - `readdirSync` order is filesystem-dependent and not guaranteed by Node. It comes
 *   back sorted on APFS and effectively arbitrary on ext4, which is the difference
 *   between a developer's Mac and CI.
 * - A plain `.sort()` is lexicographic, so it only yields numeric order while every
 *   filename is zero-padded to the same width — `10_x.sql` sorts before `2_x.sql`.
 *   The sequence is parsed and compared as a number instead, so padding is cosmetic.
