 *
 * The allow-list is exact-match on the `Origin` header and the header is echoed back
 * rather than answered with `*`, because `*` is incompatible with credentialed
 * requests and would silently stop working the day the UI needs cookies. `*` is
 * still accepted as configuration for a throwaway setup, and then genuinely means
 * "any origin".
 *
 * This must be installed *before* `bearerTokenAuth`. A browser sends the preflight
 * `OPTIONS` without an `Authorization` header, so auth-first ordering rejects every
 * preflight with a 401 and the real request is never sent — which surfaces in the
 * browser as an unexplained CORS error rather than as an authentication failure.
